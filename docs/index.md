# What is biograder?

The `biograder` package is a Python package that provides
hints and automatic feedback to students as they work through
bioinformatics homework assignments in Google Colab.
These homework assignments allow students to have hands-on
coding experiences with real data.
The data used in the homework problems comes from the `cptac`
package.
(For more information about the `cptac` package, visit [this
