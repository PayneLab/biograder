# Automatic Homework Grading, Hints, and Feedback

The `biograder` package is a Python package that automatically grades bioinformatics homework assignments. 
The package additionally provides hints and instant feedback to students as they work through the 
assignments in Google Colab. These homework assignments allow students to have hands-on coding experiences 
with real data. The data used in the homework problems comes from the `cptac` package. (For more information 
about the `cptac` package, visit [https://paynelab.github.io/cptac/](https://paynelab.github.io/cptac/)).


## How to use the biograder package

The `biograder` package is intended to be accessed and used through the 
Google Colab interface. Homework assignments have been designed in Google 
Colab for the following classes:

- [BIO 165: Introduction to Bioinformatics](https://paynelab.github.io/biograder/bio165)
- [BIO 462: Computational Cancer Biology](https://paynelab.github.io/biograder/bio462)
